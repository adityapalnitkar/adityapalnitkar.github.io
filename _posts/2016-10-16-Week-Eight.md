## What did I do this past week? ##

This week in class, we went over some differences between C++ pointers and C++ arrays. We also looked at how allocators work in C++, as well as the differences between explicit deallocation and garbage collection. Monday’s class was especially helpful in starting on the Allocator project. I’m flying solo on this project, but I’m pretty much done, just have a few wrinkles to iron out before I can begin writing unit tests. 

## What's in the way? ##

Not much, especially since the first round of midterms in all my classes is over. I have a few more interviews scheduled next week which I will study for. Project 2 grades were recently released and yet again, I lost points on something trivial like documentation. I really need to focus on all parts of the projects equally when I work on them. I’m also not exactly looking forward to getting back grades for the test.

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week I’ll mainly be catching up on assignments and readings. I’ll be meeting with an advisor to review my plans for the next few semesters. I also have to renew my passport before winter break since I have no literally space left after my travels during the summer working at American Airlines. Of course, I will finish the allocator project as early as possible to avoid any last-minute snafus. One of my interviews this week involves a case study which will take some preparation. 

## Tip of the week ##

I shop on Amazon a lot. Especially since the Prime student subscription is half price and Austin has 2 hour delivery. [Amazon Smile](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/about/ref=smi_aas_redirect) automatically donates 0.5% of your purchases to the charity of your choice. It costs both you and the charity nothing – you just shop on Amazon like you normally would, and do some good without any time or effort. All you have to do is update your bookmark to start shopping at [smile.amazon.com](smile.amazon.com)!

That's it for week eight, thanks for reading!
