## What did I do this past week? ##

Last week was great since I did not have much on my plate, with a slight lull in interviews and only Thursday’s OOP exam to study for. I think the exam was fair, although I am certain I will lose some points in the intricacies of the implementation for the last two questions. Although, I am very glad I reviewed the Github examples for the OOP exam. I put them on my cheat sheet as well, and they were immensely helpful since we had already looked at all of the algorithms that were on the test previously in class.

## What's in the way? ##

Honestly, not much! I’m pretty caught up with work for my other classes, so I will just take things as they come during the week. I am waiting for more companies to reach out, as well as hoping to hear back from the ones I have interviewed with regarding next steps. I already have a few offers for next summer, but options are always good.

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week will start off with an Applied Statistics exam on Monday morning, followed by a couple more interviews and assignments due during the week. Just like last week, I don’t expect it to be too stressful. Project 3 was also just released and I am looking forward to working on it.

## Tip of the week ##

Almost every website you sign up on seems to send you a barrage of unsolicited messages these days. To avoid this, I like using a disposable email address. [10MinuteMail](https://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html) is a fast and easy way to set up a temporary email address in order to steer clear of spam from websites that require email verification. I prefer [10MinuteMail](https://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html) since the email address actually “disappears” in 10 minutes, and as a result you never get any spam!

That's concludes my post for week seven, thanks for reading!
