## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, in class, we looked at inheritance using the stack vs. the heap and constructors. We also discussed refinement overriding and the idea of virtual classes. Most of the recent quizzes have been related to constructors, and I have done alright but I’d like to solidify the concepts some more before the exam. Last week was pretty laid back and I got a chance to get ahead on assignments for all my classes. I was especially happy to knock out all the units in my online finance course. We got our Algo test scores back and I did pretty well so I feel good about that class.

## What's in the way? ##

Not much, especially now that I am in decent shape with all my assignments for the next few weeks. I’m looking forward to Thanksgiving break next week since I will be traveling to the east coast to visit relatives.

## What will I do next week? ##

This week, I will finish Algo homework and the OOP project that is due on Thursday, along with a Statistics project that I am almost done with. I also have a web apps project to finish but it isn’t due until the weekend.  There’s only about 3 more weeks of school left until winter break, and I am going to start studying for the last round of midterms and finals so that I can stay updated with the material. I will also finalize my summer internship plans this week.

## Tip of the week ##

I’ve always wanted to learn morse code, and [this website](https://www.morsecode.io/) has a tutorial in a very neat layout.

That’s it for week twelve, thanks for reading!
