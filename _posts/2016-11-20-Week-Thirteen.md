## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, I worked on Life and turned it in. Since I was working solo, I had to write 70+ unit tests on my own which took a while but I turned it in with plenty of time to spare. The code for Life wasn’t that bad, but the overall design was definitely more challenging than Darwin. In class, we talked about virtual functions and dynamic casts, and discussed some more differences between C++ and Java. On Wednesday we had a talk by engineers from Spiceworks.

## What's in the way? ##

Thanksgiving break! I’m traveling to Virginia to visit some relatives and I am looking forward to a much needed break. It’s going to be hard to stay productive, but I will have to since I have two projects, and OOP, Applied Stats and Algo exams the week after. Add to that two more finals during finals week and that means I have a lot to do in the next three weeks. I am hoping I can use the down time well and review all the material for all my classes. This “home stretch” is especially important since there is a such a large portion of all my grades yet to be determined.

## What will I do next week? ##

I have Algo homework to turn in before Wednesday, so I will try to get that done as early as possible. I’ll also use the extra free time to study for OOP and Applied Statistics, two exams that I have right after we return from break. I will also take a look at the extra credit project that was just released. 

## Tip of the week ##

I hate holding when I call a customer service number. [GetHuman](https://gethuman.com/) gives you the prompts you need to navigate the phone tree that will get you to a representative the quickest. Often, there is also a direct number that gets you connected with an actual person rather than a machine.

That’s all I have for week thirteen, thanks for stopping by!
