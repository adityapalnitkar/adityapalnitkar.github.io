## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, I worked on the Darwin project with my partner. We did not get it done until the night it was due, mainly because we had to re-work our code since it had a lot of getters and setters.  In hindsight, we should have designed our code better. I also had an Algorithms exam last week, which led to lesser time for the both of us to work on the project. I think I did well on the exam, and we also finished the project in time with all the requirements complete and builds passing. We even found time to implement a best creature, which was actually just a slight modification of rover. In class, we discussed the move operator and wrote a move assignment and constructor as part of a vector class.

## What's in the way? ##

Not much. Since we had an Algo exam last week, there is no homework to turn-in this week. I also don’t have any projects except OOP coming up so I anticipate this week will be laid back. Recruiting has gone well for me and I have a few offers that I am currently trying to decide between.

## What will I do next week? ##

I will get started on the next project – Life. My focus will be to find a partner and finish this last project as early as possible. Election Day is coming up - whatever your political view, remember to go vote and make your voice heard!

## Tip of the week ##

[This website](http://investedinstead.com/) tells you what you would have made if you had invested the price of an iconic product at launch into the company stock instead. It is a pretty cool website to play around with. If you want to get started on investing small amounts, I’d recommend [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/) (it lets you trade without fees).

That's all I for week eleven, thanks for stopping by!
