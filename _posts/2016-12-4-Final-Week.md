## Experience in the class ##

OOP with Downing is easily one of the best CS classes I’ve taken at so far. I enjoyed the #lectures#, and it was important to pay attention at all times since he picks out students to answer questions at random. This wasn’t hard to do since Downing is a great lecturer and his lectures were engaging. Each class started off with a quiz – I lost more points on the quizzes than I would have liked, and they were definitely challenging but I will say they reinforced material from the previous lecture pretty well. The topics we covered consisted of the intricacies of C++ and object oriented concepts. We usually went over C++ code – discussing it, comparing it to Java, and working on implementations as a group. Occasionally, we had guest speakers come by – I enjoyed these talks because it was very cool to hear from grads about their experience working in the industry. 

The #projects# were interesting, and not too difficult. However, they were not limited to just cranking out C++ code – we had to write unit tests, documentation, ensure continuous integration and pass other project requirements. The last 3 projects were especially great since they left me with a solid grasp of C++ and OOP concepts. 

There were two #exams#, and all the questions consisted of writing C++ code. The first test was simpler than the second, but I would definitely have appreciated some practice exams or at least the general format of questions. The time limit for both exams was a bit tight, especially test two, but as a whole the questions were fair assessments of the material taught during lecture.

Overall, I’d highly recommend this class. Professor Downing genuinely cares about the success of his students, not only in his class but also at an industry role. OOP is an enjoyable class and I’ve learned a lot of useful things in these past few months. This is my last post for this semester – thanks so much for reading!
