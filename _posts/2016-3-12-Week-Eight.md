title: Week Eight

## What did I do this past week? ##

Last week, we had engineers from Google and Redhat give talks about GCP and AWS. Prof. Downing discussed the IDB project, where we are supposed to create a feature rich website, similar to IMDB. My group has decided on a website where we scrape Crunchbase and put together information about different companies, investors, and people. We discussed multiple frameworks, and ended up deciding on using React, Bootstrap, Flask, and SQLAlchemy.

## What's in the way? ##

Spring break - this is good and bad - since a break from the regular routine is always nice, but it is easy to fall behind on things that are due during/after break (like this blog!). Other than that, not much, especially since the first round of midterms in all my classes is over. 

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week I’ll be in Virginia visiting some family. The plan is to go skiing somewhere in the area and take a road trip to North Carolina. I will also try to get ahead on work for all my classes. Mainly, I want to try and get my group together (electronically) and finish some work on the next project to avoid any last-minute snafus.

## What's my experience of the class? ##

Last week, we only had two days of class. We also had two talks, one where we were explained Google Cloud Platform and the other went over the intricacies of Amazon Web Services. I liked these talks since we got the gist of how to use these services in an easy to understand presentation.

## Tip of the week ##

I shop on Amazon a lot. Especially since the Prime student subscription is half price and Austin has 2 hour delivery. [Amazon Smile](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/about/ref=smi_aas_redirect) automatically donates 0.5% of your purchases to the charity of your choice. It costs both you and the charity nothing – you just shop on Amazon like you normally would, and do some good without any time or effort. All you have to do is update your bookmark to start shopping at [smile.amazon.com](smile.amazon.com)!

That's it for week eight, thanks for reading!
