## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, I finished and turned in the Collatz project. I also had Statistics and Algorithms homework that I completed during the week.
What I liked about the first project was that the code was actually the simplest aspect of the project. The tricky part was dealing with errors on Windows, Travis failing unexpectedly and issues running the tests. That said, the project was not too bad overall, but there is room for improvement as outlined below.

- The instructions for this project were quite unclear. While I understand Prof. Downing wants us to ask questions and clarify on Piazza, it would have helped to have well defined project requirements from the start. As for the actual turnin, the files required were listed in a Piazza post but there were frequent changes being made to what was expected.

- I feel like we should have access to the testing script the graders use. It is very unsettling knowing that I can be docked points even though everything may have worked just fine after running make test but the code may have issues that were not caught. Currently, it just seems like there is a lot of uncertainty regarding things out of my control that could affect my grade.

## What's in the way? ##

In class, we learned about C++ pointers and references. Although I have worked with C pointers in my last two semesters, I think it’s going to take me longer to master reference variables. I could also tell from my quiz score on Friday that I need to spend more time reviewing the readings and exploring these fundamental concepts on my own.

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week, I’d like to catch up with assignments in all of my classes. The Career Fair is also coming up and I plan to continue my preparation for interviews through online code questions. Once the second project is released, I will begin work on that to finish as early as possible.  

## Tip of the week ##

Most of you may already do this, but I usually try to solve programming problems on an actual whiteboard rather than just practicing on a computer with a compiler. Also make it a point to ask the recruiter about the format of the interview and coding questions in advance. Being prepared will make it will be easier to navigate a complex scenario presented to you in a real interview and reduce the chance that you will freeze and forget something simple like how to initialize an array.

That concludes my post for week three, thanks for reading!
