## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, we learned more about C++. I can tell it is very important to practice pointers and references to gain mastery of the material. On Wednesday, Chris Martin from Bloomberg took the time to give us an idea of what the industry is like. He also explained what kind of tools companies currently use to optimize their code. I was pleasantly surprised by how I did in the quizzes this week so hopefully I can keep that perfect score streak going. I also set up a repo for Netflix and read through the project guidelines.

## What's in the way? ##

I’ve been swamped with work for pretty much all my classes this weekend, with back to back due dates and exams. I’m trying to balance school work and preparing for the career fair and (hopefully) the interviews that will follow. Although all my projects so far this semester are interesting, I feel it’s going to take extra motivation to complete them well before the due date just because of the sheer amount of things that need attention at the same time.

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week will make it a month in to the semester. I feel this is finally the point where I have my schedule set. I am trying to get fully started on Netflix and hope to make significant progress well before the due date. I am also very excited and looking forward to making the most of Career Fair on Tuesday.

## Class Experience ##

One thing I noticed is that the projects in OOP do not have strict requirements in place. The specifications are fluid and often change even due to Piazza posts. This has taken me some getting used to but I guess it is important since that’s how it works in the real world, especially with Agile methodologies.  

## Tip of the week ##

Although everyone uses CTCI for interview prep, I personally rate [Elements of Programming Interviews: The Insiders' Guide](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1479274836/) highly as well. One of the authors used to be a professor in UT’s ECE department. I feel that it has more “difficult” questions than many similar books, which is good experience since more coverage always helps when preparing for interviews at any top software company. 

That's it for week four, thanks for dropping by!
