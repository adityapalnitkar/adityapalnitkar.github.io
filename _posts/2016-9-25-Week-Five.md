## What did I do this past week? ##

Like everyone else, my last week was quite busy as well. The career fair was on Tuesday and I was lucky to get a couple interviews in the following days. I tried to talk to as many companies as I could and stayed at the fair for all 5 hours since I believe there is no substitute for personal interaction with recruiters. For the Netflix project, my partner and I used other groups’ caches and got our algorithm to run in under a minute with an RMSE of 0.97. Although the project itself wasn’t too bad, we had issues with Github Classroom and TravisCI, leading to some stress before turn in. Just like project 1, I felt that the submission process was more overwhelming than the actual work. In class, I enjoyed the presentation by Alex from JPL, especially the VR view of Mars with a HoloLens.

## What's in the way? ##

I have exams in almost all my classes coming up in the next two weeks, as well as more interviews approaching which require extra time and study. I also need more practice in C++, since my partner and I spent a lot of time during Netflix googling simple syntax. Personally, I have used Java more in the past so I still tend to get confused when it comes to differences with C++. We often found ourselves following an implementation which turned out to be wrong or unnecessary.

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week, I will study for my tests and finish up some more online internship applications. I will continue to prepare for my technical interviews. I will also make a note sheet for the OOP exam, since there is a lot of new material like C++ iterators, pointers and references that I do not have much experience with.

## Tip of the week ##

As computer science students, most of us spend a lot time sitting at a desk working on a computer. In college and industry, exercise and maintaining a good posture is crucial. With the 7 Minute Workout, you can always squeeze some high-intensity exercise. Breaking a quick sweat every day is better than skipping exercise entirely, especially when free time is tight. Personally, I have noticed an overall productivity and a decrease in stress. Try it out!

This concludes my post for week five, thanks for reading!
