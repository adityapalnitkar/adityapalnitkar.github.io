## What did I do this past week? ##

This week, I got started on the reading and began work on the Collatz project. In class, Prof. Downing spent some time going over the steps required to set up the project properly. We also reviewed an algorithm to determine if a number is prime and looked at how to fix broken unit tests. Meanwhile, I got Travis CI and Docker working on my Windows laptop.

## What's in the way? ##

I think I have the project setup correctly and haven’t noticed any issues so far. I feel that the instructions and setup required for this project seem more daunting than the actual code itself.

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week, I’ll complete and turn in the Collatz project. I’m trying to use the “test-first” style I learnt during my internship by writing a whole bunch of unit tests before I finish major pieces of the code. I’m also trying to catch up on a lot of work for all of my other classes since I know the recruitment season is fast approaching and I want to stay ahead before it gets too busy. I’m also in the process of updating my LinkedIn and polishing my resume.
  
## Pick of the week ##

I take a lot of online courses/video tutorials to pick up technology/business skills outside of class. One of my favorite sources for online learning since I started at UT is Lynda.com.  Their library is vast and provides intensive training for even advanced software. I especially like their instructors since all of them are vetted and create high quality content. As a UT student, you get access to all the Lynda courses for free. Just go here, enter “utexas.edu” and sign in with your UT EID!

That's all I have for week two, thanks for stopping by!
