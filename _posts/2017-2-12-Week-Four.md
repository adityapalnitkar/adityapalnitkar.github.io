## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, we talked some more about Python concepts. I started working on the Netflix project with my partner and we got a lot done on Friday. Since I took OOP last semester, the project has been quite straight-forward for me since it is the same problem, except in Python instead of C++. I was also pleasantly surprised by how well I did in the quizzes this week, so hopefully I can keep that perfect score streak going.

## What's in the way? ##

Nothing much - and although all my projects so far this semester are interesting, I feel it’s going to take extra motivation to complete them well before the due date just because of the sheer amount of things that need attention at the same time.

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week will make it a month in to the semester. I feel this is finally the point where I have my schedule set. I am trying to finish Netflix at the start of the week, well before the due date, and potentially try for extra credit. I also have a Compilers lab due on Tuesday so I will focus my attention there. Career Fair is this week, and although I have an internship for the summer, I may go volunteer.

## Class Experience ##

Just like last semester, Downing's lectures have kept me engaged. As for the projects, I've noticed that the workflow and specifications are fluid and often change even due to Piazza posts. This has taken me some getting used to but I guess it is important since that’s how it works in the real world, especially with Agile methodologies.  

## Tip of the week ##

Another tip related to recruiting since EXPO is coming up - everyone uses CTCI for interview prep, but I personally rate [Elements of Programming Interviews: The Insiders' Guide](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1479274836/) highly as well. One of the authors used to be a professor in UT’s ECE department. I feel that it has more “difficult” questions than many similar books, which is good experience since more coverage always helps when preparing for interviews at any top software company. 

That's it for week four, thanks for dropping by!
