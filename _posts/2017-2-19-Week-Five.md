## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, my partner and I finished and turned in the Netflix project. We used other groups’ caches and got our algorithm to run in under a minute with an RMSE of 0.98. The project really didn't take too long - we had it done by the weekend and just had to optimize it a bit, add unit tests and check corner cases before submission.

## What's in the way? ##

I have exams in almost all my classes coming up in the next two weeks, so I have to split my time between class assignments, review and study. I definitely need more practice in Python, since I noticed that my partner and I spent a lot of time during Netflix googling simple syntax. We often found ourselves following an implementation which turned out to be incorrect or unnecessary. Personally, I have used Java more in the past so I still tend to get confused when it comes to differences with Python.

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week, I will study for my tests and finish some assignments for my other classes. I also plan to make a note sheet for the SWE exam, since Python is a language I am not at all familiar with, so I want to get as much practice as possible. I'd also like to review all the code examples and class notes before the upcoming test.

## What’s my experience of the class? ##

The class material is getting slightly more difficult, in my opinion. I was a bit lost when we covered lambdas/closures. The quiz questions are always based off examples from class and my streak of 5s on the quizzes was broken at the start of last week. I spent some time this weekend reading the class notes and looking over the code again to make these topics clearer. 

## Tip of the week ##

As computer science students, most of us spend a lot time sitting at a desk working on a computer. In college and industry, exercise and maintaining a good posture is crucial. With the [7 Minute Workout](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/) ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.popularapp.sevenmins), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/7-minute-workout-free-daily/id650762525)), you can always squeeze some high-intensity exercise. Breaking a quick sweat every day is better than skipping exercise entirely, especially when free time is tight. You'll notice an increase in overall productivity and a decrease in stress. Try it out!

That's it for week five, thanks for reading!
