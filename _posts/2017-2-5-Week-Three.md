## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, I finished and turned in the Collatz project, and worked on some Marketing homework that was due Friday. I also had a Compilers lab due on Thursday that I finished during the week. This week was definitely busier than the previous few and all my classes are really starting to gear up.

## What's in the way? ##

In class, we talked some more about Python and how types work. Python is pretty tricky even though it looks fairly simple to learn. For example, it took me a while to get used to using tabs and indentation rather than curly brackets. My quiz scores tell me that I need to spend more time reviewing the readings and exploring some fundamental Python concepts on my own.

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week, I’d like to catch up on assignments in all of my classes. The second project - Netflix has been released, so I will begin work on that to finish as early as possible.  

## What’s my experience of the class? ##

For this first project, the code was actually the simplest aspect of the project. The tricky part was dealing with Hackerrank test cases that give zero feedback, Travis failing unexpectedly and issues with the workflow. That said, the project was not too bad overall, but there is room for improvement in the project specifications. 

First, I felt that the instructions for this project were quite unclear. While I understand Prof. Downing wants us to ask questions and clarify on Piazza, it would have helped to have well defined project requirements from the start. Second, I did not appreciate the acceptance criteria being changed the day before the project it was due. I had already finished my program, and had the json file filled up and ready to turn in. Initially, it was enough to turn in code that passes Hackerrank. However, on Wednesday evening we were told to re-add a lazy solution to support numbers above 5 million. This took more time than I expected since I had to add a unit test to boost up the code coverage, but that test took over 15 minutes to run. This caused my Travis build to time out and fail so I had to add a flag to tell Travis to wait longer. The extra work isn't that much of a problem, but it creates more room for trivial errors close to the due date.

## Tip of the week ##

The spring career fair is in two weeks. While I have an internship for the summer, for those still recruiting, make it a point to solve programming problems on an actual whiteboard rather than just practicing on a computer with a compiler. Also remember to ask the recruiter about the format of the interview and coding questions in advance. Being prepared will make it will be easier to navigate a complex scenario presented to you in a real interview and reduce the chance that you will freeze and forget something simple like how to initialize an array.

That concludes my post for week three, thanks for reading!
