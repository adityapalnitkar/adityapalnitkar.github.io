## What did I do this past week? ##

Last week was very busy! I had three tests and three major assignments due back to back, so I spent most of the week studying! I did pretty well on the SWE exam - I thought the exam was very fair, although the format was a big surprise compared to the OOP test last semester. I am very glad I reviewed the Github examples while studying for the SWE exam. I put them on my cheat sheet as well, and they were immensely helpful since we had already previously looked at all of the algorithms that were on the test.

## What's in the way? ##

Honestly, not much! I’m pretty caught up with work for my other classes, so I will just take things as they come during the week. I just have one exam next week and nothing else major that is due.

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week, I'd like to work with my group and come up with project ideas for the SWE website before we all disperse for spring break. I have a Compilers test on Thursday, and on the weekend I am heading to Virginia to visit some family. I'm looking forward to a nice week-long break after a hectic few weeks this spring semester.

## What’s my experience of the class? ##

Lectures are engaging as always. I was not that worried about the SWE exam since I knew what format to expect. However, when I saw that the Canvas assignment said 19 questions, I definitely got worried. With multiple choice questions, there is no room for partial credit. The last few questions that asked about correct implementations were tricky too, since guessing wrong is punitive. All in all, I will say that I prefer this exam format rather than having to just implement code. 

## Tip of the week ##

Almost every website you sign up on seems to send you a barrage of unsolicited messages these days. To avoid this, I like using a disposable email address. [10MinuteMail](https://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html) is a fast and easy way to set up a temporary email address in order to steer clear of spam from websites that require email verification. I prefer [10MinuteMail](https://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html) since the email address actually “disappears” in 10 minutes, and as a result you never get any spam!

That's concludes my post for week seven, thanks for reading!
