## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, I worked on Phase 3 of the IDB project with my group. In this phase, we mainly have to (1) implement search for our website and (2) create a visualization of another group's data and models using D3. To implement search, we used a library called [Flask-WhooshAlchemy](https://github.com/Revolution1/Flask-WhooshAlchemyPlus). We also had an issue with our website getting "hacked", but later realized that it is actually Isotope - the plugin we use to display grids on our website - that had an issue. 

## What's in the way? ##

Not much, last couple weeks of the semester left. I have three projects due this week but I have been staying on top of them. I did not do very well on the quiz questions from the refactoring book, so I'd like to review the material some more.

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week, I will work on the last phase of the IDB project with my group. Creating a visualization is the main task left now. I also have a Compilers lab due Tuesday and other homework due later in the week. I'd like to start studying for my last round of midterms and finals that are coming up. Registration is approaching and I expect to graduate in Fall 2017 so I want to intricately plan out my course work with my advisor sometime during the week. 

## What’s my experience of the class? ##

In class, we covered refactoring techniques. These are handy but it is important to know which situations to use refactoring in. As I mentioned earlier, the quiz questions based off the Fowler book were pretty tricky, and I did not do very well on them. We also went over Java concepts like dynamic binding. I am enjoying the switch to newer material.

## Tip of the week ##

Registration is coming up next week - often times, it helps to look over the syllabus of a class from a past semester to get an idea of what to expect. [UT has a system](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/student/coursedocs/nlogon/) where you can look up syllabi (and even Professor CVs) which I’ve found to be helpful when deciding between classes.

That’s it for week twelve, thanks for reading!
