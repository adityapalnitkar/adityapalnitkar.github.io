## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, I studied for and took a Networks midterm. I had to balance that with working on Phase 2 of the IDB project with my group. I especially spent some time trying to further my understanding of how our website works in all aspects. In our project we use the Crunchbase API, however, we did not realize that it only allows access to only about a hundred instances for free. Fortunately, we figured out a way to work aroud it that Prof. Downing approved. I also spoke with my advisor and got credit for my Hindi language test that I took two weeks ago - which gave me a nice 6 credit boost in my degree plan.

## What's in the way? ##

Motivation! There is only a month of classes left in this semester, and it seems to get harder to stay focused in this final stretch. Although I have no tests coming up in the next few weeks, I have homework and assignments due almost every week which I will have to stay on top of. 

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week, I will continue working with my group to finish up on the second phase of the IDB project. My quiz grades have gone down bit in the past two weeks after a streak of perfect scores so I will try to bring those up again. I will also catch up on homework and other assignments. In my Compilers class, I’m not very confident about some of the material we have gone over in the past two weeks so I will probably watch some videos to solidify those concepts.

## What’s my experience of the class? ##

In class, we discussed Regular Expressions, SQL, XML and JSON. We also had a talk by Atlassian engineers who talked about issues they encountered in their technologies like Hipchat, JIRA and Trello.

The main difference that I notice between this class and OOP is that in SWE we are learning skills that are very useful in the industry. Developing a full website with a database backend and working with a large team in a project is very relevant to the real world and is also a very marketable skill.

## Tip of the week ##

This is a cool website that lets you [convert your handwriting into a font](http://www.myscriptfont.com/). It doesn’t always work perfectly for some letters, but that may have something to do with my especially illegible handwriting! :)

That's it for week ten, thanks for reading!
