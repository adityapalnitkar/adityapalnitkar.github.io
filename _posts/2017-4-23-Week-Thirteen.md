## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, I worked on Phase 3 of the IDB Project with my group. In this phase, we implemented website-wide search using Flask-WhooshAlchemy. The second main requirement was creating a visualization of another group's website using D3. Overall, this phase was pretty straightforward compared to the previous ones. 

## What's in the way? ##

Not much! There's only two more weeks left in this semester before summer break. Between the end of the semester and my internship, I'll be traveling to Eastern Europe after my last final, which is in less than 3 weeks! It's crucial that I keep my focus and stay productive in these final class days. Although next week is pretty relaxed, but I have three exams in the last week of the semester, so I am hoping I can use the next week and review all the material for all my classes. This “home stretch” is especially important since there is a such a large portion of all my grades yet to be determined.

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week, I will work with my group and prepare our presentation for SWE - we are due to present on May 1st. I will also start studying for the final exam in this class and wrap up work for my other classes. I will continue to work on the Compilers final project which is the last major assignment I have due this semester. 

## What’s my experience of the class? ##

The class is going great - I am especially enjoying the switch to Java concepts and refactoring techniques. I ended up taking SWE after enjoying OOP with Prof. Downing last semester and I'm glad I did - I've learned a lot.

## Tip of the week ##

I love to travel, and I recently found this [interesting website which tells you the best places around the world to visit on any given week based on weather](http://decisiondata.org/the-best-time-to-visit-anywhere/). Data can be used in very fascinating ways!

That’s all I have for week thirteen, thanks for stopping by!
