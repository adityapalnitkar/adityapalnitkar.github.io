## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, I worked with my group to prepare our presentation for the IDB project. I also starting studying for the SWE test and worked on projects for my other classes.

## What's in the way? ##

I have three exams and two major projects due in my classes next week. It's important to keep focus, since a large portion of my grade in almost every class is yet to be determined. We have covered a lot of material in SWE since the last exam, like SQL, Regex, JSON, Java, etc. It's a lot of new information so covering all the topics plus the readings while studying is a challenge. 

## What will I do next week? ##

Next week, I will present [our website](http://www.sweatshop.tech) with my group in class. I will continue studying for the SWE exam - I want to revise all the material and create a cheat sheet soon. I will also wrap up work for my other classes and mainly devote time to work on my Compilers final project due at the end of the week. 

## What’s my experience of the class? ##

Last week we concluded the course with some more refactoring techniques. Having each group present their website is great since it is interesting to see what each group made and how they made it.

## Tip of the week ##

I recently stumbled upon [this episode of NPR's Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/07/22/487069271/episode-576-when-women-stopped-coding) that looks into what happened in 1984 that made the number of women involved in computer science plunge. Also, if you've never heard the Planet Money podcast, turn back now - otherwise you will spend time learning about economics instead of studying for finals :-)

That’s all I have for week fourteen, thanks for stopping by!
