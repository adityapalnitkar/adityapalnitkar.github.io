## What did I do this past week? ##

This past week, I worked on Phase 2 of the IDB project with my group. We redesigned our website and changed the look and feel from the first phase. In the backend, we scraped the Crunchbase API and filled our database with hundreds of values for each model. We had to do a fair bit of manual data collection and parsing using scripts since the Crunchbase API allows only very limited access for free.

## What's in the way? ##

I'm not doing very well on the quizzes in this class - they have gotten harder in my opinion. I need to stay on top of the readings and review the material on my own to keep my grade up. Plus, there's less than a month left of this semester so there's a general lack of motivation.

## What will I do next week? ##

I will get started on Phase 3 of the IDB project with my group. From the project description, it seems that Phase 3 may take lesser time than the first two phases took, but we plan to start early and get the project finished as soon as possible. I will also continue working on my next assignment for Compilers and go over my schedule for the Fall semester with my advisor during the week. 

## What’s my experience of the class? ##

I feel like we went over Relational Algebra and SQL pretty fast - I took a database management classa couple of semesters ago though, so I'm not too worried. Altogether, SWE has given me a good grasp of languages and tools using in the industry and I'm very interested to see what we go over in the short remainder of this semester.

## Tip of the week ##

I’ve always wanted to learn morse code, and [this website](https://www.morsecode.io/) has a tutorial in a very neat layout.

That's all for week eleven, thanks for stopping by!
