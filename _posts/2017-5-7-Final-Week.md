## Experience in the class ##

SWE with Downing is easily one of the best CS classes I’ve taken so far. I enjoyed the **lectures**, and it was important to pay attention at all times since he picks out students to answer questions at random. This wasn’t hard to do since Downing is a great lecturer and his lectures were engaging. Each class started off with a quiz – I lost more points on the quizzes than I would have liked, and they were definitely challenging but I will say they reinforced material from previous lectures pretty well. The topics we covered consisted of the intricacies of Python, SQL, JSON, XML and some Java concepts. We usually went over code from pre-written examples – discussing it, comparing it with other languages, and working on implementations as a group. Over the course of the semester we also had some guest speakers come by – I enjoyed these talks because it was very cool to hear from grads about their experience working in the industry. (and there were some extra credit points for attending the talks too!) 

The **projects** were interesting, and were very fair in terms of the time they took. However, they were not limited to just cranking out Python code – we had to write unit tests, documentation, use version control, ensure continuous integration and pass other project requirements. The last 3 projects were especially great since we built an entire website from scratch. I was left with a solid grasp of full stack development, teamwork, and new technologies like Angular and React. 

There were two **exams**, with all multiple choice questions. This was a big change from OOP last semester since the exams in that class consisted of writing the code rather than verifying written code. Therefore, the first test was a curveball in terms of the format for me since I was expecting the same as OOP. The second exam went a lot better since I knew what format to expect. Downing does not provide practice exams but the in-class quizzes are a great reflection of the  general format of the questions. I felt that the exam questions were a fair assessments of the material taught during lecture.

Overall, I’d highly recommend this class. Professor Downing genuinely cares about the success of his students, not only in his class but also at an industry role. SWE is an enjoyable class and I’ve learned a lot of useful things in these past few months. This is my last post for this semester – thanks for reading!
